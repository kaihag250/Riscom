Even so, scientists have seen a roughly 4 to 6% increase each year in advanced prostate cancer diagnoses.

Sarcoidosis, a systemic inflammatory condition of unknown origin, is increasingly being linked to environmental and occupational exposures. However, exposure histories are rarely sought during clinical evaluation. The study's authors argue that the term silicosarcoidosis can help bridge this gap by acknowledging silica exposure as a significant and modifiable risk factor in some patients with sarcoidosis.
