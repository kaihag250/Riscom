"A study published in theBMJlooks at online supervised group physical and mental health rehabilitation programme for adults with long Covid after Covid hospitalisation.Dr Baptiste Leurent, Associate Professor in Medical Statistics, UCL, said:“This is a well conducted randomised controlled trials, and the findings appear relatively robust, although not unequivocal.  There is limited research on addressing symptoms of long covid and this study is therefore an important contribution.“The study found a 0.03 higher ‘quality-of-life’ at 3 months for those who received the rehabilitation programme, compared to standard care.  Quality-of-life is a standardised index capturing ‘overall health’, from 0 (death) and 1 (full health).  0.03 is a relatively modest effect, but could be considered sufficient to be worthwhile.","risk_communication: 1

On average, the participants were around 56 years old, and slightly more than half were women.

The researchers divided the participants into three groups based on how much coffee they drank each day. The first group, which made up 22.1% of the participants, did not drink coffee regularly. The second group, the largest at 58.4%, drank between half a cup and three cups per day. The final group, 19.5% of participants, drank more than three cups daily.

"As an example, if we take an earlier nirsevimab trial (MELODY) – Hammit et al, NEJM 2022 – they had 25 medically-attended RSV-associated low respiratory tract infections among 496 infants in the placebo group (5%) versus 12 in 994 on nirsevimab (1.2%) – put differently, out of 1,000 infants in the MELODY trial, 950 will never be hospitalised because of RSV, 50 will be hospitalised if not treated, 12 will still require hospitalisation even if treated.  This means a relative reduction (RR) of 76% (95% confidence interval 53-88%) and an absolute reduction (RD) of 3.8% (from 1.8 to 5.9%) – 38 fewer per 1000 (from 18 to 59).  This translated into a number needed to treat of 26 (from 56 to 17) – one fewer hospitalisation due to RSV every 26 infants receiving nirsevimab (best case 17, worse case 56), from data from the MELODY trial.","risk_communication: 0
