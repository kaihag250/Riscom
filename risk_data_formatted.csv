The trial lasted about 3.4 years. An interesting tidbit about this trial is it was stopped early because of an interim analysis that showed benefit. Ultimately, the trial showed that semaglutide compared with placebo showed a 20% risk reduction in development of a kidney-specific composite endpoint. ","Risk communication: 1
